# File Organizer Project

My final project for [CS50P](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/).

#### Video Demo: [Youtube Link]().

#### Description: I wrote this script to organize any messy directory and assign the files into separate folders. The directories configuration can be found in the `directories.py`. After the files are organized, you can also choose if you want to remove the unorganized files from the base directory. The folder that you want to be organized should be put in resources directory.

### Make commands

- run `make init` to make sure all necessary packages are installed
- the script can be run with `make run`
- code can be formatted with black by running `make format`
- code can linted with ruff by running `make check` and `make fix`
- code can be tested with `make test`

### Built with

- python
- pytest
- black
- ruff
- shutil
- pathlib
- sys
- re
- os

<!-- File Organizer Project
Organize any messy directory in a matter of seconds.
I really enjoyed both lectures and assignments. Some of them took me a while to finish but it was nonetheless very satisfying to complete all of them. Now I feel like I became friends with Python and I can use it to build whatever I want. -->
