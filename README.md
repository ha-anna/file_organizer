# File Organizer Project

My final project for [CS50P](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/).

#### Video Demo: [Youtube Link]().

#### Description: I wrote this script to organize any messy directory and assign the files into separate folders. The directories configuration can be found in the `directories.py`. After the files are organized, you can also choose if you want to remove the unorganized files from the base directory. The folder that you want to be organized should be put in resources directory.

### Make commands

- run `make init` to make sure all necessary packages are installed
- the script can be run with `make run`
- code can be formatted with black by running `make format`
- code can linted with ruff by running `make check` and `make fix`
- code can be tested with `make test`

### Built with

- python
- pytest
- black
- ruff
- shutil
- pathlib
- sys
- re
- os

### Commit guide

- `feat` – a new feature is introduced with the changes
- `fix` – a bug fix has occurred
- `chore` – changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src
  or test files (for example updating dependencies)
- `refactor` – refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `docs` – updates to documentation such as a the README or other markdown files
- `style` – changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related
  to code formatting such as white-space, missing semi-colons, and so on.
- `test` – including new or correcting previous tests
- `perf` – performance improvements
- `ci` – continuous integration related
- `build` – changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `revert` – reverts a previous commit

<!-- File Organizer Project
Organize any messy directory in a matter of seconds.
I really enjoyed both lectures and assignments. Some of them took me a while to finish but it was nonetheless very satisfying to complete all of them. Now I feel like I became friends with Python and I can use it to build whatever I want. -->
